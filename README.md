## Risks 
```
- root user access should be replaced with IAM user who only have limited permission. 
- I copied the nginx conf to replace the default one to point the port nodejs use to the port Nginx use. But I use nginx latest as the docker image. It might has issue in future nginx image update. I can choose to build my own image but it is too large to upload. 
- nginx server use http which is not very secure. should use https. 
- Ubuntu firewall setting should comply with company policy. I use some basic settings only. 
- Provisioner part used too many shell scripts. Once one script is failed the rest will fail and difficult to debug. 
Using a customized docker image can help lowing the deployment risk especially for the node js deployment part. 
- code is public on github. should delete it once got reviewed. 
- key pair should not be used. Better use AWS Key Management Service.
